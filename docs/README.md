## EveryCRED Blockchain Network

### Using the Hyperledeger Fabric for that 
- Permissioned Blockchain Network Designed for the Enterprise Solution 
- Provide Tracibility 
- Provide Realibility 
- Provide better Speed As compare to the Public Blockchians like (etherium , bitcoins,solana)
- No Need to pay the gas fees


### The Project Structure we Building is Look like this [[files.md]]


### Deployment Plan

    Stages of building and launching

Example:

    ✔️ Phase 1: Local network with Solo ordering

    🔁 Phase 2: Switch to Raft ordering

    🔐 Phase 3: CA-based identity management

    🌐 Phase 4: Multi-org onboarding and chaincode APIs

    ☁️ Phase 5: Cloud hosting (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)


### Tools & Tech 
1. Hyperledger fabric 2.5.12
2. Fabric CA - for the certificates
3. Solo + Raft for the consensus or say orderer
4. Dynamic network with the automation scripts
5. use the dockerized setup for that
6. Node apis
7. couchdb for the stroing the onchain data
8. postgres for the backend data
9. frontend is build in the angular

###  Benefits

    Tangible results of adopting this system:

    🔒 Improved security and data integrity

    🧾 Auditable transaction records

    🤝 Transparent inter-org collaboration

    📉 Reduced fraud and verification time

    ⚙️ Automation of trust-based workflows

#### Timeline and the Delivery 


    Estimation of delivery:

Phase	Description	Est. Time
Phase 1	Solo Dev Network Setup	1 week
Phase 2	Raft + Multi-org	2 weeks
Phase 3	CA integration	1 week
Phase 4	Chaincode + APIs	2 weeks
Phase 5	Frontend + Testing	2 weeks

### First Glance what we're building

Feature	Your Setup
Platform	EveryCRED
Use Case	Verifiable Credentials (W3C standard)
Fabric Architecture	Single Org, Raft ordering service
Storage Layer	On-chain Fabric Ledger (Channel data, not CouchDB only)
Identity Engine	Fabric CA or Cryptogen (both supported)
Interfacing	APIs (FastAPI?) + Chaincode
Goal	Issue, store, and verify credentials immutably




### Why we use the Hyperledger Fabric for the EveryCRED

Benefits to the Platform:

    ✅ W3C Verifiable Credential data is signed, timestamped, and tamper-proof

    ✅ On-chain traceability of issuance, revocation, updates

    ✅ Private, permissioned access using MSPs (can later scale to multi-org)

    ✅ Strong identity binding (Fabric CA certs + W3C issuer.id)

    ✅ High throughput and fast finality with Raft


### What is the our goal is for buiding this 

Goal: Store VC as JSON on the ledger via smart contract

    Store full or hash of W3C-compliant VC on the ledger

    Track issuance + revocation + verification

    Each VC is bound to an issuer DID (issuer.id) and subject DID

🔨 Step-by-Step Task Blueprint
🔧 1. Setup Raft-based Single Org Fabric Network

    Create configtx.yaml with Raft ordering

    Use cryptogen or fabric-ca for Org1 identities

    Create genesis + channel blocks

    Launch network (docker-compose)

👉 I’ll give you exact config files if you want.
